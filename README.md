### What is this repository for? ###

* Quick summary
    + This repository is for the DMACC Advanced C++ group project. To use this repository, you will want to install a git client, I use [git-scm](http://git-scm.com/downloads). You will also need Qt installed to run the GUI, I'm using [Qt Creator](http://qt-project.org/downloads) for this. I also used the following pages to get my Qt setup to be able to pull from my git repo:
    *[Set up Git SSH](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Set+up+SSH+for+Git)
    *[StackOverflow question about setting up Qt with Git](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20336561/what-is-the-correct-way-to-configure-qt-creator-to-use-git)
* Version

### How do I get set up? ###

* Summary of set up
    + Once you have the files downloaded and Qt installed (the default options are fine for this project), open an existing project and select POS2.pro. That should be all you need to compile the project.

* Dependencies
    + This project is dependent on the Qt framework.
